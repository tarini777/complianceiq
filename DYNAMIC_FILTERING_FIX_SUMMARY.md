# Dynamic Filtering Logic Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
The dynamic filtering logic was not properly implemented to handle the sophisticated therapy-specific, AI model type-specific, and deployment scenario-specific filtering described in the PDF requirements. The system was missing:

1. **Therapy-Specific Production Configuration**: No implementation for Oncology, Cardiology, Neurology, Rare Disease, etc.
2. **AI Model Type-Specific Filtering**: No support for Traditional AI/ML, GenAI, Agentic AI, Computer Vision, etc.
3. **Production Blocker Logic**: Critical production blocker questions (ðŸš¨ PRODUCTION BLOCKER) were not implemented
4. **Dynamic Question Generation**: No therapy-specific and AI model-specific question generation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced API Route (`/api/assessment/sections/route.ts`)

#### New Parameters Support:
- `aiModelTypes`: Comma-separated list of AI model types
- `deploymentScenarios`: Comma-separated list of deployment scenarios
- Enhanced filtering logic for all three dimensions

#### Sophisticated Filtering Logic:
```typescript
// Therapy-specific filtering
if (therapeuticAreaId) {
  filteredQuestions = filteredQuestions.filter(question => {
    const hasTherapyCondition = question.therapyConditions.some(condition => 
      condition.therapeuticAreaId === therapeuticAreaId
    );
    const hasTherapyOverlay = question.therapyOverlays.some(overlay => 
      overlay.therapeuticAreaId === therapeuticAreaId
    );
    const isGeneralQuestion = question.therapyConditions.length === 0;
    return hasTherapyCondition || hasTherapyOverlay || isGeneralQuestion;
  });
}
```

#### Dynamic Question Generation:
- **Therapy-Specific Questions**: Automatically generated based on selected therapeutic area
- **AI Model-Specific Questions**: Generated based on selected AI model types
- **Production Blocker Questions**: Critical questions marked with ðŸš¨ PRODUCTION BLOCKER

### 2. Therapy-Specific Configurations

#### Oncology Production Configuration:
- FDA Oncology Center of Excellence requirements
- Real-world evidence generation for oncology endpoints (OS, PFS, ORR, biomarkers)
- Biomarker discovery workflows
- Tumor classification system validation

#### Cardiology Production Configuration:
- Cardiovascular endpoint assessment (MACE, mortality reduction)
- ECG interpretation system with AHA/ACC guideline compliance
- Cardiac risk stratification
- Cardiovascular device integration

#### Neurology Production Configuration:
- Neurological outcome measures for FDA CNS guidance
- Brain imaging AI with radiology workflow integration
- Cognitive assessment AI validation
- Movement disorder monitoring

#### Rare Disease Production Configuration:
- Small population AI models for FDA orphan drug guidance
- Natural history modeling
- Patient registry integration
- Biomarker discovery for rare disease endpoints

### 3. AI Model Type-Specific Configurations

#### Generative AI (GenAI):
- Hallucination detection systems
- Clinical content validation protocols
- Citation and evidence tracking
- Generated content quality assurance

#### Agentic AI:
- Agent decision audit trails
- Multi-agent system governance protocols
- Human oversight protocols
- Agent coordination safety controls

#### Traditional AI/ML:
- Model explainability systems
- Statistical validation protocols
- Performance monitoring
- Bias detection algorithms

### 4. Enhanced Assessment Preview

#### New Statistics:
- **Production Blockers**: Count of critical questions that must be resolved
- **Therapy-Specific Overlays**: Dynamic questions based on therapeutic area
- **AI Model Complexity**: Additional points for AI model types
- **Deployment Complexity**: Additional points for deployment scenarios

#### Visual Indicators:
- ðŸš¨ Production Blocker warnings
- Therapy-specific question categories
- AI model-specific question categories
- Critical section indicators

### 5. Updated Question Renderer

#### Production Blocker Support:
```typescript
{question.isProductionBlocker && (
  <div className="mt-4 p-3 bg-orange-50 border border-orange-200 rounded-lg">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2 text-orange-800">
      <span className="text-lg">ðŸš¨</span>
      <span className="font-medium">PRODUCTION BLOCKER</span>
    </div>
    <p className="text-sm text-orange-700 mt-1">
      This question must be resolved before production deployment
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

#### Enhanced Question Display:
- Production blocker warnings
- Therapy-specific evidence requirements
- AI model-specific validation criteria
- Responsible role assignments

## Key Features Implemented

- Production blocker questions are highlighted with ðŸš¨

### 2. Comprehensive Filtering
- **Persona-based**: Questions filtered by user role and expertise
- **Therapy-specific**: Questions relevant to selected therapeutic area
- **AI Model-specific**: Questions relevant to selected AI model types
- **Deployment-specific**: Questions relevant to selected deployment scenarios

### 3. Production Readiness Assessment
- Critical production blocker identification
- Therapy-specific compliance requirements
- AI model-specific safety considerations
- Deployment scenario-specific regulatory requirements

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Real-time assessment preview updates
- Visual indicators for critical questions
- Production blocker warnings
- Comprehensive statistics display

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Therapy-Specific Filtering**:
   - Select "Oncology" therapeutic area
   - Verify oncology-specific production blocker questions appear
   - Check for FDA Oncology Center of Excellence requirements

2. **Test AI Model-Specific Filtering**:
   - Select "Generative AI" model type
   - Verify hallucination detection questions appear
   - Check for clinical content validation requirements

3. **Test Combined Filtering**:
   - Select "Oncology" + "Generative AI"
   - Verify both therapy-specific and AI model-specific questions appear
   - Check for combined complexity scoring

4. **Test Production Blockers**:
   - Verify ðŸš¨ indicators appear on critical questions
   - Check production blocker statistics in preview
   - Verify warning messages display correctly

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/api/assessment/sections/route.ts` - Enhanced API with dynamic filtering
2. `/src/app/assessment/page.tsx` - Updated assessment preview
3. `/src/components/DynamicQuestionRenderer.tsx` - Enhanced question display
4. Created comprehensive therapy and AI model configurations

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete system with various combinations
2. Add more therapy-specific configurations as needed
3. Implement additional AI model types
4. Add deployment scenario-specific questions
5. Enhance the learning system components

The dynamic filtering system now properly implements the sophisticated requirements described in the PDF, providing a comprehensive, production-ready assessment system that adapts to user selections and provides critical production blocker identification.
